This is known as the superfluid discount factor, and it can be changed by Osmosis governance.\n\nTherefore, for example, if you put in $100 dollars of total assets, $25 worth of OSMO will be superfluid staked. The $50 worth of ATOM will provide a safety buffer, since the whole LP is slashable. \n\n(Note: The proportion of ATOM to OSMO will change from 50/50 as OSMO and ATOM change price. The chain logic will keep track of these changes and give you credit for your OSMO accordingly.)\n\nWhen other chains start using interfluid staking, the other half of a pool will no longer provide extra collateral, so it may make sense to set the superfluid stake percentage at 90%, for example, to provide a margin of safety.\n\nSlashing is what happens when validators misbehave badly, double-signing a transaction or colluding to attack the chain. Bonded assets can be burned to raise the costs of such an attack. In the case of superfluid staking, any slashed funds will be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool. Slashing is another reason to be thoughtful about your validator selection.",
