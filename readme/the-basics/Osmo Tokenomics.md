&#x200B;

Around here generally everyone knows that the when you add a new Block to the Bitcoin Block-chain you are rewarded with Bitcoin(BTC) for doing so. This is known as "Mining" (As of now, in 2021, the block reward is **6.25** BTC per block added to the chain and will decrease by a 1/2 every 4 years till the total supply of 21,000,000 BTC are in existence.)

&#x200B;

**Osmo takes some inspiration from this model but with a few important differences.**

&#x200B;

# Unlike Bitcoin where tokens are distributed on a per block basis,

**Osmosis has daily epochs and releases new tokens only at the end of each epoch. ( Every Epoch is 24/hrs long and finishes at 17:30 UTC)**

&#x200B;

This means that you have 24 hours to position yourself on the Osmosis blockchain and you are rewarded based on the ways in which you bring value to the chain (Either by staking for security or by providing the funds for the liquidity that allow the swap pools to operate)

&#x200B;

# Similar to Bitcoin’s halvening, where token issuance is decreased by a 1/2 every four years,

**Osmo instead goes through a "thirdening " every year where the Epoch rewards will be cut by 1/3rd the amount.**

&#x200B;

In the first year, there will be a total of 300 million tokens released for rewards. After 365 days, this will be cut by ⅓ to a total of 200 million tokens released in Year 2 and then 133 million in Year 3, And so on.

[ This thirdening process will allow OSMO to reach an asymptotic maximum supply of 1 Billion, meaning that it will never reach a billion tokens but will continue cutting by 1\/3 nearly indefinitely](https://preview.redd.it/szduc86qum281.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4873df617e70a069fbd2febe4ffa55b9d2316123)

# Since we're still in the 1st year of Osmosis,

We are currently getting 300 million Osmo this year, or roughly 821,917 new Osmo per day to be distributed to you for participating in activities that help support the health of the Exchange.

&#x200B;

# Lets take a look at how these 820k new Osmo are distributed to the Osmonaut community.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Every day at Epoch time, nearly 820,000 new Osmo is distributed to these 4 categories](https://preview.redd.it/2qgr21p60n281.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0399609e2b1f55bc06c812c2100f81b78b226e47)

&#x200B;

# 369,863.01 Osmo are distributed to everyone who participates in pooling with Osmosis.

This is the exact amount of daily Osmo to be shared between each and every single pool and each and every single pool provider.

&#x200B;

[This is what the current distribution of funds looks like between each pool, and new pools are constantly being added to the list ](https://preview.redd.it/w1wgq5prpy281.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b70f3b1384fd02e34b05a805c4802bc33c26890)

# This token model is intended to be adapted and updated by the community over time.

Adjustments to the model can be proposed and voted on through on-chain governance. OSMO holders should feel empowered to change the token model of the chain as necessary to support their vision for the platform.

&#x200B;

Together as a community we can ensure that the very best Cosmos Native Dex is being built for the entire ecosystem. Please voice your opinions, get into healthy discussions about potential paths forwards, and vote in governance. (Even if it's a vote for abstain because you are unsure, it really helps the community in the long run.)
